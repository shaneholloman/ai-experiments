# AI Experiments

A repository for experimenting with various AI models and capabilities from Anthropic and OpenAI.

## Overview

This repository contains various experiments and implementations using modern AI models, primarily focusing on Anthropic's Claude and OpenAI's GPT models. It serves as a sandbox for testing different AI capabilities, prompt engineering techniques, and integration approaches.

## Features

- Experiments with Anthropic's Claude models
- Implementations using OpenAI's GPT models
- Environment variable management for API keys
- Various AI use cases and applications
- Documentation of findings and best practices

## Technologies Used

- **Python** - Primary programming language
- **Anthropic API** - For accessing Claude and other Anthropic models
- **OpenAI API** - For accessing GPT and other OpenAI models
- **python-dotenv** - For managing environment variables and API keys

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Anthropic API key
- OpenAI API key

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shaneholloman/ai-experiments.git
   cd ai-experiments
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your API keys:
   ```
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   ```

### Running Experiments

Navigate to the `src` directory and run the desired experiment:

```bash
python src/experiment_name.py
```
